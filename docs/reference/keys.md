# Keys

> Geometry Dash uses [XOR Cipher](#) combined with [base64 encoding](#) to protect various strings within the client. Multiple Keys are used to protect different aspects of the game

## XOR Keys

## XOR Types

> there are **two** ways Geometry Dash applies [XOR Cipher](topics/algorithms/xor.md) to strings - **Static** and **Cycled**
>
> - Static Ciphers apply the key as is without any changes applying to the key itself.
> - Cycled Ciphers iterate through each value on the key one by one and then loops back once it reaches the end.
